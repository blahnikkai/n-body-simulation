# N Body Simulation
# https://blahnikkai.github.io/n-body-simulation

## Simulation
Smoothly simulates 100+ bodies of different masses affecting each other with gravitational forces

Each body has its own mass, position, velocity, and acceleration

Note that the simulation is at a 5x time scale

## Adding bodies
Instantly add pre-made initial conditions like elliptical orbits, resonant orbits, binary star systems, and randomly initialized bodies

Add a body by simply clicking the simulation area to set position, mass, and initial velocity  
Or if you want to add a body more precisely, use the 'Add a Body' form on the right side of the page.


## Deleting bodies
Clear all bodies with the 'Clear All Bodies' button  
Or delete an individual body by right-clicking it

## Visuals and Camera
Move the camera with WASD and zoom in/out with +/-
Reset the camera zoom and position with the 'Reset Camera' button
Focus on a body by left-clicking it. To unfocus on it and reenter free camera mode, left-click the focused body.

Pause and play the simulation or step frame-by-frame

Use checkboxes to control whether acceleration and velocity vectors, debug information, or a path trace are drawn.
