# N Body Simulation
# https://blahnikkai.github.io/n-body-simulation

## Simulation

Simulates any number of bodies affecting each other through gravitation

Smoothly simulates 100+ bodies of different masses

Each body has its own mass, position, velocity, and acceleration

## Creating bodies
Instantly add pre-made initial conditions like elliptical orbits, resonant orbits, binary star systems, and randomly initialized bodies

Add your own bodies by simply clicking the simulation area to set position, mass, and initial velocity
Or if you want to add a body more precisely, use the 'Add New Body' form on the right side of the page.

## Visuals

Move the screen with WASD and zoom in/out with +/- 

Pause and play or step frame-by-frame

Control whether acceleration and velocity vectors are drawn
